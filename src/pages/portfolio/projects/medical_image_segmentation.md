As part of my PhD in Biomedical Engineering, I’m developing a novel AI-driven system to assist in the detection of pancreatic cancer from ex-vivo biopsy samples. This system supports surgeons during pancreatic resection by ensuring clean surgical margins, helping reduce recurrence and improve patient outcomes.

The system combines state-of-the-art deep learning models with advanced optical imaging techniques — bringing together tools like Meta’s Segment Anything, UNet, and GradCAM to form a robust and explainable pipeline. It’s a practical example of how modern AI can be applied to solve critical challenges in biomedical imaging.

A paper detailing part of this work — including our UNet-based segmentation pipeline, CNN classification with post-processing, and tissue isolation using SAM — has been accepted for presentation at the SPIE Optics + Photonics 2025 conference. The publication and companion poster will be shared here once released in August.
